Personal website of **Oscar Mañas**, Research Scientist at **Meta Superintelligence Labs** (Media Generation team), Zürich.

## Research

I work on **multimodal generative models**, systems that understand and generate images, video, and text from multimodal inputs. I’m especially interested in building models that reason fluidly across modalities, treating them as complementary channels of perception and thought.

**Keywords:** multimodal AI · vision-language models · image generation · video generation · text generation · multimodal LLMs · diffusion models · autoregressive generation
