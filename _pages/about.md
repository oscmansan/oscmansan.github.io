## About me

Hi, my name is Oscar Mañas.

I am a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/), advised by Prof. [Aishwarya Agrawal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~agrawal/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, to provide machines with a holistic understanding of the world around them. I currently work on building multimodal (vision + language) systems by reusing (frozen) pre-trained vision encoders and language models. My long-term goal is improving the out-of-distribution generalization of multimodal systems, which is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications. I am also interested in methods for reducing the computational cost of deep learning.

Previously, I was a research intern at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/research) in Montreal, under the supervision of [Pau Rodríguez](https://prlz77.github.io) and [David Vázquez](http://www.david-vazquez.com). I obtained a [M.Sc. in Computer Vision](https://pagines.uab.cat/mcv) from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat), and I carried out my master's thesis at the [Image Processing Group](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/) advised by Prof. [Xavier Giró](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/xavier-giro). Before, I obtained a [B.Sc. in Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis at the [Architectures and Compilers Group](https://arco.e.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) advised by Prof. [Antonio Gonzalez](https://people.ac.upc.edu/antonio) and Dr. [Jose-Maria Arnau](http://jarnau.site.ac.upc.edu).
