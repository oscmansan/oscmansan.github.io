## About me

I am Oscar Mañas, a research intern at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/research) in Montreal, under the supervision of [Pau Rodríguez](https://prlz77.github.io) and [David Vázquez](http://www.david-vazquez.com). I will be joining the PhD program at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) in Fall 2021 advised by Prof. [Aishwarya Agrawal](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/a/aagrawal307/index.html). I am interested in sample-efficient machine learning algorithms, i.e. learning semantic representations from multimodal data with reduced (human) supervision. I am also interested in methods for reducing the computational cost of deep learning.

Previously, I obtained a [M.Sc. in Computer Vision](https://pagines.uab.cat/mcv) from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat), and I carried out my master's thesis at the [Image Processing Group](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/) advised by Prof. [Xavier Giró](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/xavier-giro). Before, I obtained a [B.Sc. in Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis at the [Architectures and Compilers Group](https://arco.e.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) advised by Prof. [Antonio Gonzalez](https://people.ac.upc.edu/antonio) and Dr. [Jose-Maria Arnau](http://jarnau.site.ac.upc.edu).
