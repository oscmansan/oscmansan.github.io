Hola! I'm Oscar Mañas. I am a **Research Scientist at [Meta Superintelligence Labs](https://ai.meta.com/)** on the Media Generation team. I recently completed my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/), advised by Prof. [Aishwarya Agrawal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~agrawal/).

My research explores the intersection of vision and language, with a focus on **multimodal vision-language generative models**: systems capable of generating images, videos and text from multimodal inputs. I'm especially interested in building models that reason fluidly across modalities, treating each as a complementary channel of perception and thought. My long-term vision is AI systems that learn continuously from multimodal interactions, becoming deeply embedded in the way humans perceive, think, and communicate.

Previously, I was a Visiting Researcher at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), advised by Dr. [Michal Drozdzal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-drozdzal-a36b9b42) and Prof. [Adriana Romero](https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home). I was also a Research Intern at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/research) in Montreal, advised by Dr. [Pau Rodríguez](https://prlz77.github.io) and Dr. [David Vázquez](http://www.david-vazquez.com). I obtained a [M.Sc. in Computer Vision](https://pagines.uab.cat/mcv) from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat), and I carried out my master's thesis at the [Image Processing Group](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/) advised by Prof. [Xavier Giró](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/xavier-giro). Before, I obtained a [B.Sc. in Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis at the [Architectures and Compilers Group](https://arco.e.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) advised by Prof. [Antonio Gonzalez](https://people.ac.upc.edu/antonio) and Dr. [Jose-Maria Arnau](http://jarnau.site.ac.upc.edu).
